## Decription
I created this to be used at my job at a Whole Foods Market meat market. It is a Sinatra/ActiveRecord application. You can create an account with a secure password, create orders, edit orders, and delete orders.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'market-orders'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install market-orders 
      

## Built With

Sinatra - web application framework.
Active Record - ORM
